        <div><h2>a dish of beef, typically coated in pa&#770;te&#769; de foie gras, wrapped in puff pastry, and baked.</h2></div>
          <p>
          Where can you possibly go wrong with a decadent slab of beef encased in crispy puff pastry crust and 
          sloshed over with gravy and mushrooms? (Well, if you are vegan, vegetarian, or hate beef, pastry, 
          or pa&#770;te&#769; de foie gras, this dish could be very wrong for you. *clears throat*) 
          I have only had if cooked to medium-well. However, in my online search for photos, I discovered 
          many seem to prefer it still 'moo-ing'. 
      </p> 
      <p> I have also not have the beef wrapped in pa&#770;te&#769; de foie gras, which is apparently a pa&#770;te&#769; of fat goose 
          liver and usually truffles sometimes with added fat pork. I am not 'fancy' enough to know off the top of 
          my head what that was, so I looked it up. You are welcome, as you probably not 'fancy' either. (Though you
          could be...I am making a lot of assumptions here) Can't say I am very sorry that part was missing. 
          My husband recreates this jewel of a dish sometimes when I have been very good, as it does take a decent 
          amount of time and preparation. Each morsel is worth of every minute you don't have making it.</p>
